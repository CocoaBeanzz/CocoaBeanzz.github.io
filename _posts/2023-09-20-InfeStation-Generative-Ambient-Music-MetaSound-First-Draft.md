## Generative Ambient Music with MetaSounds in Unreal Engine 5

{% include elements/video.html id="JQxVQkRO5qA" %}

InfeStation, the upcoming sci-fi horror shooter from Black Hole Syndicate, 
will feature a generative ambient music system using MetaSounds in Unreal Engine 5.
<br>
<br>
This first draft of the music system lays the foundation for the style of the game's atmospheric sound. 

### Setting the Tone

The game's setting is a derelict space station named the StarBright 12. This craft has been overrun by vicious creatures. 
The crew is long gone, either via the ship's escape pods or as treats to the station's ravenous new inhabitants. 
The player awakens from stasis well after the initial chaos and is tasked with escaping this infested ship.

I sought to capture the cold, empty feeling of an abandoned space station, 
ridden with the horrific tension of monsters scittering throughout its hull. 
This took the form of piercing ethereal screeches echoing in a reverberant abyss,
nervous clicks and taps that rattle through your head, 
and booming impacts like the shudders of the station's decaying frame, 
all encased in a bed of static grit reminiscent of a distant, dying radio.

My colleague Max had drafted some music for this project previously from which I drew heavy inspiration.
My task upon joining this team has been to refine and develop upon the groundwork Max had set.

References for InfeStation's musical style include Martin Stig Andersen's work on Control,
Morton Subotnick's Silver Apples of the Moon, Mikko Tarmia's soundtrack for SOMA, 
Mick Gordon's compositions for Prey and Doom, and Allessandro Cortini's album SCURO CHAIRO.
