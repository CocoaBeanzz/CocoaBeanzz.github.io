### Lyrics
Do you ever think about frogs, man<br>
Like, what are they even doing<br>
With their wack-ass eyes and shit<br>
Not a care in the world just<br>
Hi ho, eat bug<br>
They're just mad chillin'<br>
I wanna be a frog<br>

Hi ho, eat bug<br>
Like, dude<br>
You know<br>
Frog<br>
I really want to be a frog<br>
Wack-ass frog<br>

Bro, but like, what if we are frogs<br>
Like, what if we're two frogs<br>
Chillin on a mushroom<br>
And this is all just a crazy dream<br>
Like we're just a couple of frogs just tripping balls together<br>
Wouldn't that be crazy<br>
No, wait, dude I, I think<br>
I'm a monkey<br>

Hi ho<br>
You ever think about frogs, man<br>
Holy shit, I want to be a frog so bad<br>
Ribbit<br>
