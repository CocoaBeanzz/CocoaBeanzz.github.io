## Fallen (K10 Anniversary Remix) is out for streaming and purchase!

Fallen is out now for streaming and purchase on all platforms!<br>
<br>
This is an old composition of mine that I hold near and dear to my heart, completely reworked to capture the brilliance and impact I had envisioned 8 years ago. In the remix process, I felt compelled to write vocals for this version, an open letter recounting the journey I've made since I originally wrote this track. <br>
<br>
Thank you, everyone who's helped me in this journey.

### Lyrics
Wherever you are,<br>
Wherever your life takes you,<br>
I hope that somehow you hear this.<br>
I never forgot you.<br>
I never gave up.<br>
No matter how much I've fallen,<br>
I'm alive.<br>
<br>
I'm not afraid anymore.<br>
I know who I am.<br>
I'm stronger now,<br>
And I'm going to make it.<br>
I couldn't have done it without you.<br>
I understand now.<br>
I see why I had to fall.<br>
<br>
Thank you.
