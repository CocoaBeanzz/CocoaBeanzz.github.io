Northstar Kitchens is an animated short student film by [Heather Parsons](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heatherparsons234). <br><br>
The film depicts a mock advertisement for a futuristic kitchen appliance company, 
featuring an assortment of robotics, levitation devices, and advanced automated cooking systems. <br><br>
As a class exercise, I redesigned the sound for this film from scratch. <br><br>
The music in the redesigned film is extracted from my soundtrack for [Power Chord](/projects/2112-power-chord). <br><br>
The sounds in the film are a mix of foley and synthesized sounds. I'm particularly fond of the synthesized robot sounds (see the clip below).
