Welcome to Fernando's Italian Slice House, a fun family-style restaurant that's fun for the whole family!<br><br>

F.I.S.H. is a uniquely challenging, fast-paced kitchen experience that will leave you hooked!<br><br>

Making pizzas is easy, right? All you have to do is find all the right ingredients, put them on a pie, bake it, and serve it right up! However, in this kitchen, things aren't always as easy as they seem... Get ready for the ultimate bait and switch as the roles are reversed! Experience the thrill of deception and the rush of escape in this pizzeria game where you are the ingredient!<br><br>

Why am I being chased by this strange cardboard cutout of an Italian man?<br><br>
