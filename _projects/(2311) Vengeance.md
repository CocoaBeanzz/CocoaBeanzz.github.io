Vengeance is a 2D platforming story-driven adventure game set in a Latin-American inspired fantasy world. <br><br>
The player controls Dayana, a sheltered, naive princess who is cast into adventure when her parents are overthrown and murdered by her nefarious aunt. Now exiled from the kingdom, she sets out to reclaim the throne through a path of vengeance, companionship, and betrayal, with the help of a blade possessed by the spirit of the Centipede Knight. <br><br>
Despite the tragic circumstances, Dayana manages to retain her lighthearted, youthful attitude, often joking around with Centipede Knight throughout her journey.
